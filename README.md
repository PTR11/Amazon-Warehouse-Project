# Amazon-Warehouse-Project (Team Brute Force)
This is an university project. 
Simulate an operation of delivery robots in a warehouse, with the goal of bringing all of the products to their stations
This program is a WPF application(MVVM architecture) written in  C#.
Mainly I was responsible for the frontend (view & view model), but I helped in the model and business layer too.
